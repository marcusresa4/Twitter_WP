# Twitter Api
Twitter Api show the impact produced as a consequence of the tweets which contain specific hashtags. Relating a user with the Tweets he has published and the repercussion that those tweets have produced. Also we can see it at the other way around, given a hashtag, or a statistic (i.e. number of retweets) connect it to the tweets and the users who have wrote them.
